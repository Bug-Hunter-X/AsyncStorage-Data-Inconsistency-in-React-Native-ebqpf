# React Native AsyncStorage Bug: Asynchronous Handling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage. The problem arises from incorrect handling of the asynchronous operations of AsyncStorage's methods, leading to data inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The core issue is accessing data retrieved from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous operation completes. This results in undefined values being used in subsequent operations, causing errors or unexpected application behavior.  The timing of these errors is often unpredictable, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly using promises or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage's methods. This ensures that data is accessed only after it has been successfully retrieved.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
4. Observe the error related to accessing undefined values.
5. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
