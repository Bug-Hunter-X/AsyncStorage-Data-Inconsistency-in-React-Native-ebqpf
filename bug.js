This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue stems from improperly handling the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage's methods.  Specifically, attempting to access the retrieved data before the asynchronous operation completes leads to undefined values or unexpected behavior. This is often masked by seemingly random occurrences, making it difficult to debug. The code below illustrates a common scenario where this problem occurs.  The `someFunction` attempts to use the value before the `getItem` call has resolved, which causes the `value` variable to be undefined, causing an error further downstream.
